In this first reflection post, I will reflect on the experience of completing the project.

For the following part, we write as a group.

## Project Achievement

In this project, we build an interactive webpage demonstrating data of the tax and transfer system by states using dash, flask, and plotly. This webapp could help people understand EITC and states EITC rules and be used to analyze the relationship between EITC and unemployment/poverty.

We are especially proud of the interactive plotly graphs with detailed information and links to authoritative data sources. Though it’s hard to draw any statistically significant relationship, our data show that EITC does help alleviate poverty and decrease unemployment.

## Future Work

Now as we’ve shown that EITC has a positive effect, the next goal is to encourage more target poor working families to claim EITC and propose some policies to raise the amount of EITC. We can publish some policy memos and add links to direct users to EITC criteria and tax assistance in each state.
 
After polishing it, we will deploy it using heroku and make it public.


## Proposed & Outcome

At first, we aim to construct models to calculate the optimal tax rate. However, through our research, we found that it’s much harder than we thought and requires more academic knowledge. Though we have the data, it’s difficult to adjust for the economic cycle and other possible factors. Hence, we narrow down our topics to EITC in the tax and transfer system and only draw conclusions from graphs. What we’ve achieved are data analysis and building an interactive web app.

The following part is my individual reflection.

## Lessons Learned

Thanks to the instructions from Prof. Chodrow and TA John, I learned how to work with others using git and GitHub. I also practiced a lot with Plotly graphs and learned how to make interactive Plotly dash apps with callback.  I now know how to make web apps look better with assets. What’s more, I learned lots of knowledge on U.S. tax system and EITC while researching for the project.

## Beyond and Above

I learn how to build interactive websites and draw fancy Plotly graphs. Analyzing, interpreting, and demonstrating data are an important part of work for policy analysts and researchers. Inspecting this data, I was inspired to write a policy memo on imposing city-wide EITC at Los Angeles.

Learning from this experience, I will be more careful with proposals in the future. Though I did learn a lot more from a brave proposal, I didn’t fully achieve my goal since I was not equipped with enough knowledge and skills.

I also learned about the application of machine learning to economics is kind of limited. Machine learning is often used for prediction while economists care more about causal relationships and stimulation. I should learn more about econometrics before trying to combine it with machine learning algorithms.

In the furture, I would actively ask for help and rely more on the others to increase my efficiency and maximuze my "take away" from a project.
