In this first blog post assignment, I will explain how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.

## Import Data

For the first step, we import the Penguins data set using module Panda.


```python
#import database
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)

```

Now let's check the data to have a general understanding.


```python
penguins.head()

```
